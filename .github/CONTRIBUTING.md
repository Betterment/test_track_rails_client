# How to Contribute

We would love for you to contribute! Anything that benefits the majority of `test_track` users—from a documentation fix to an entirely new feature—is encouraged.

Before diving in, [check our issue tracker](//github.com/Betterment/test_track_rails_client/issues) and consider creating a new issue to get early feedback on your proposed change.

## Suggested Workflow

* Fork the project and create a new branch for your contribution.
* Write your contribution (and any applicable test coverage).
* Make sure all tests pass (`bundle exec rake`).
* Submit a pull request.
